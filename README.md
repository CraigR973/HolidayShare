TO-DO

Moved the requests into the profile page cause there's noting really on there

Pages left to do:

Find 
(Need to pass session variable to results)

Share 
(Form is there, doesn't do anything yet)

Results
(Gets variable for what the user searched and returns the results from the database)

Profile 
(Shows the requests you've made, the requests people have made from you and the status of those requests)


Other Shit:

Password Hashing
